GENERAL
-------
Standard file name: GatewayConfig.xml
Exact XML file can be individually configured in the ini-files for each module.

STRUCTURE OF THE XML:
---------------------
	Introduced with: <config>
	Each gateway of the simulation has its own section and is represented as follows:
		<gateway id=“gateway name“>
			…
		</gateway>
	Each gateway can contain tags for the routing module, for the buffering module and for all transformation modules. The exact order does not matter here.
	
	Routing:
	--------
	The configuration of the routing module starts with the tag <routing>. From this point all different routes are defined that run through this gateway. Each route is displayed as follows:
		<route source=“source port number“ destination=“destination port number“>
			…
		</route>
	Under each route it’s determine which messages are forwarded. For each route only one type of message can be sent. There are the following options:
		<canframe canId=““/>
		<ethernetframe dst=““/>
		<rcframe ctId=““/>
		<ttframe ctId=““/>
		
	Transformation:
	---------------
	The transformation module contains the parameters for the destination port and the target technology (Ethernet or Can). It is configured as follows:
		<transformation destination=“ destination port number “ type=“toEthernet/toCan“>
			…
		</transformation>
	The items within the transformation tag contain information about the messages that should be forwarded to the appropriate destination.
	If the source is a Can network and the destination a best-effort-ethernet the underlying elements are configured like this:
		<ethernetframe dst=“Ethernet destination address“>
				<canframe canId=“ID can frame“/>
				…
		</ethernetframe>
	RC and TT messages are initiated with the tags <rcframe ctId = ""> or <ttframe ctId = "">.
	If messages are forwarded to Can, the source ethernet frames and their address or ctId are given:
		<ethernetframe dst=““/>
		<rcframe ctId=““/>
		<ttframe ctId=““/>
	
	Buffering:
	----------
	The buffering module is used to determine which messages should be grouped together in a frame and how long each message will be delayed for buffering. Each buffering module within a gateway uses the same configuration. The configuration starts with the tag <buffering>.
	It follows the tag <pool> which represents a set of messages that are grouped together. Then each message with the appropriate hold-up times can be configured:
		<Holdup time = "">
			<Canframe canid = "" />
			...
		</ Holdup>
